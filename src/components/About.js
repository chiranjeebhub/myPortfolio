              Out of numerous professions out there, I choose Computer Science
              because of the unique learning opportunity it provides. Like an
              actor who gets to play different characters, we developers get to
              develop projects in various fields. That exposes us to a vast
              array of knowledge that a regular person never gets to learn in a
              lifetime.
